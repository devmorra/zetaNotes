####Question 1 of 6
What is the purpose of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model?

 	The OSI model provides an alternative model to Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) that corrects many of the stability issues inherent in TCP/IP but is fully compatible with all protocols, addressing, and technologies employed by the TCP/IP model.
 	The OSI model provides a reference model to help users understand networking, how various software and hardware elements work together, and compare basic functional relationships between different networks.
 	The OSI model was a precursor to the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and has since been completely superseded by TCP/IP. OSI is now defunct and is only used today to provide historical context.
